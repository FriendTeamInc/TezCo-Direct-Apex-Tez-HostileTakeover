# Apex & Tez: Hostile Takover
As seen on the [June 30th, 2023 TezCo. Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOr98ZmKt9s)!

How this little "game" works is this: you can select any of the avilable scenes by typing a number on your keyboard, press space to view the default information screen, or escape to close the application.

Each scene is "looping" in that animations will continue playing based on how much time is passing and there is no further interaction for it to function. Each scene is meant as a fake segment of the game! Certain effects like sound and some minor additional information or animations were added in post processing of the Direct video.

This project is desgined to be run with [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.
